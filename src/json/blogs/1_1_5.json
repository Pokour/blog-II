These circuits need power to operate, and this\npower is fed to the circuits in the form of flowing electrons. In this chapter,\nwe will cover the dynamics of the electrons and how their flow is created. This\nis the first step towards understanding the most basic concept of electronic\ncomponents and circuits."

A cell is a construction in which two electrodes\nare immersed in an electrolyte, an electrolytic solution of ions. The potential\ncreated by such reactions is measured in volts, and the energy that is linked\nwith this potential is the by-product of the cell reactions. Chemicals used to\nmake a cell determines the voltage of that cell. The chemical reactions\noccurring inside the cell is called a redox reaction.
